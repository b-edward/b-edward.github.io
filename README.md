## Edward's Portfolio Website

This website was created to highlight some of my relevant software development experience, while practicing front-end web development.

This project:
* Utilizes JavaScript fetch method for dynamic loading of JSON data from NoSQL database
* Supports dynamic dark/light mode themes, and dynamic resizing for mobile, tablet, or desktop
* Frontend created without frameworks - using only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6
* Backend images and project data hosted on Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Storage and Firebase Realtime Database
* Uses custom https domain: edwardboado.dev
